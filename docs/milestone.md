# FitDB Milestone (10/1)

**Repo:** [https://github.com/jic48-rutgers/FitDB](https://github.com/jic48-rutgers/FitDB)

**Summary:** Weâ€™ll incorporate feedback the professor gave us: convert all status/indicator fields to normalized lookup tables (e.g., `*_STATUS_IND`) instead of strings; add indices, SQL roles, stored procedures, and triggers

**Plan for Weekend Before/Week of Oct. 6th**
- finalize ERDs and docs
- implement roles, triggers, views
- translate docs to build.sql
- hopefully be able to seed data with bulkcopy to test simple queries
